# Rock Paper Scissors Game
I completed the rock paper scissors game. It was a nice way of teasing the javascript language a bit. Some bugs I encountered and fixed are the break points in the case-switch statements, and I had a brain fart with the conditionals when checking for valid inputs.

## What I learned:
- Got better at writing the case switch statements
- Got some practice with the beautiful and concsie arrow functions
- Revamped my programming neurons a bit!
